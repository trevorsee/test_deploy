Design and development for a <span class="link dim out">[new public website](https://ppmroadmap.com)</span> for Roadmap.
{: .measure-wide }

**Updated infrastructure allowing easy editing**
<br>
The main reason for updating the website was to move to a system that allowed non-technical employees to easily update copy and blog posts. We used this as an opportunity to make visual improvements across the board to the website, bridging the gap between Roadmap 1.0 and Roadmap 2.0.
{: .measure-wide .pb1 }

{% assign image = "trevorcarr-dot-info-roadmappublic2.png" %}
{% include srcset-imgix.html %}

**Show the app**
<br>
We wanted to put visuals of the app front-and-center. Rather than only a list of features or reasons why a visitor should try it out, showing the powerful features of Roadmap directly.
{: .measure-wide }

**Quick and easy signups**
<br>
We decided to include a trial sign-up on the bottom of each page. At any point while scanning or browsing the website a visitor can begin a free trial.
{: .measure-wide }

**Technical Specifications**
<br>
We wanted to build the website quickly and efficiently, so we used <span class="link dim out">[Basscss](http://basscss.com/)</span> and <span class="link dim out">[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)</span>, using <span class="link dim out">[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/)</span> as a CMS to allow easy editing.
